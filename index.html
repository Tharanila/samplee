<p>Shin Chan- a name so oft heard and so dear to his huge legion of fans who clamour about just like him! A complete family entertainer as it has come to be now, Shin Chan is a sure shot dose of relaxation. However, all’s not so rosy about this boy kid of the times. As black comedy and dark slap stick manifests itself through the character, Shin Chan draws critics as well. Yet Shin Chan’s real story is one that is remarkably tragic.
But even as lame jokes have time and again irritated audience and critics alike, Shin Chan continues to be a global brand.
